ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
----------------

giix is inspired and uses code from Yii PHP framework and gii-template-collection.
Many thanks to Qiang Xue, Herbert Maschke and the contributors of these software.

FEATURES
--------

giix extends Yii's gii by providing:
- Proper handling of related model attributes, rendering of appropriate form fields based on relation type.
- More support for HAS_MANY and MANY_MANY relations.
- Automatic string representation for a model via GxActiveRecord::representingColumn() and GxActiveRecord::__toString().
- Out-of-the box i18n support by using Yii::t().
- Appropriate form fields are rendered based on model attribute/table field data type.
- Separated model and basemodel. Basemodel can be regenerated without overwriting your code in the model.
- Generated code is (almost) free of comments.

Some of these features come from gtc.
