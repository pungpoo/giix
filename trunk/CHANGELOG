giix Change Log
===============

Version 1.1, to be released
----------------------------
Enh: All inline styling and formatting is removed from the generated code.
Bug: GxActiveForm::enableAjaxValidation value was passed as a string instead of as a boolean in _form.php, causing it to ever evaluate to true. This caused a new record to be added in every ajax validation post (There weren't a call to GxController::performAjaxValidation).

Version 1.0, 2010-11-12
----------------------------
Initial release, based on gii-template-collection (gtc).
Updated up to gtc r107 and yii/gii 1.1.3 r2247.
